# Flight-Simulator-in-Virtual-World
Create a game that let you explore virtual world in which you fly over heightmap-generated terrain. In the game you can fly (using WASD keys) a dragon, the F18, or any other complex object lit with ambient, diffused AND specular light (homework 4). Your would must have a skybox and billboard clouds (homework 5), grassy terrain made using heightmapping (new thing, but available on ilearn) AND wavy water/lake/sea in some areas (homework 6). IMPORTANT: you have to have separate vertex and pixel shaders for each flying object, skybox, billboard clouds, grassy terrain heightmapping, and wavy water.
